# Libraries #
The iOS libraries for Google Play Games and Google+ are no longer included
here. You must download the following packages and extract them into this
folder:

* [Google Play Games Services for iOS](https://developers.google.com/games/services/downloads/)
* [Google+ iOS SDK](https://developers.google.com/+/downloads/)

After the libraries have been extracted, the folder should appear as follows:

- ios-samples/Libraries
- ios-samples/Libraries/GoogleOpenSource.framework
- ios-samples/Libraries/GooglePlayGames.bundle
- ios-samples/Libraries/GooglePlayGames.framework
- ios-samples/Libraries/GooglePlus.bundle
- ios-samples/Libraries/GooglePlus.framework
